## Description

By using BootStrap as a framework, I have put together an initial portfolio. I utilized BootStraps built in responsive features to allow the site to appear proper on desktop and mobile. In order to try and break away from the out-of-the box BootStrap look, I added my own CSS. Per the instructions of the assignment, I tried to limit the use of my own CSS and use as much BootStrap as I could. 

For the global template, I made the main section look as if it is floating off of the body. This initially was not an artistic choice but an attempt to build the site as it is presented in the image examples in the homework folders. It turns out that that floating look is just the way GitLab formats it display of images. Instead of removing the code, I decided to stick with it. Since the main is floating as it is, I has to take an unorthodox approach and put the footer inside the main. I do not know how this will affect a screen reader but on this site the footer is more of a design element than a functional element. I decided to make the NavBar the sticky element despite the assignment asking for sticky-footer. I did not like the look or feeling of a sticky-footer. The page has a better flow with the navbar sticking to the top. 

The gallery page is built but only has place holders in the gallery for now. It too is fully responsive for mobile. On a desktop it utilizes the BootStrap grid system but goes into a single column for smaller devices. 

The contact page has a fully built out contact form. For now though, it is only a framework. I attempted to use action="mailto:" to have the form actually be submitted but that functionality was limited. By clicking submit, it is opening the default mail app on the client machine. After doing so research, I have come to the conclusion that the solution I am looking for to the form submission problem cannot be solved by html. 

I took advantage of Google Fonts and FontAwesome to add even more customization. I ran into a stumbling block with the FontAwesome icons. I used v4.7 and there is limited functionally in regards to sizing and spacial positioning that is better handled in later versions of FontAwesome. I also had some issues with the visited color of those icons after turning them into links. I was able to find a solution by affecting the built in class that came with the icons. 

I can see the advantage of using BootStrap can be to developers. It allows for a very quick and easy deployment of a quality looking website. My only concern with BootStrap is that if it's relied upon too heavy by web developers, it leads to too much homogenous looking work.
